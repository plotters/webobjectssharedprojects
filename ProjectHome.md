A few of my personal WebObjects projects. Initially created due to requests to share.

These are provided "as is".

## WKEmailButler ##
An application for sending emails from a database.

## WKEmailData ##
A WebObjects framework used for creating email entities in the database. Emails are later sent by WKEmailButler application. Any application that wants to send emails using the WKEmailButler delegate application need only add this framework to their app and create Email enterprise objects.

## WKPrototypes ##
My own prototypes used in all my apps. Similar to Wonder's prototypes. Nowadays it is better to use Wonder's protos directly for new projects and have your own prototypes for additional useful prototypes ensuring no prototype attribute name clashes!
Included here since it is dependency of WKEmailButler.

## WKFoundation ##
Included since it is a dependency of WKEmailButler

## Getting Started ##
You need latest, or at least a recent Project Wonder source.  The initial commit was built against Wonder version #8867.
Examine and configure the Properties files with your own email address, smtp server, database host, dbuser and dbpassword.
