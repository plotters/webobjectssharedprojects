This is the OLD XCode-compatible copy of my prototypes distinguished only by having an entity name of EOPrototypes
so as not to conflict with latest Project Wonder which already has a EOJDBCPrototypes.

This is currently maintained in eclipse workspace.

General README
This framework exists simply as a mechanism to share the same prototypes entity among multiple projects
 or multiple eomodels within the same projects since only one prototypes
  "entity" can exists in an eomodels group for a loaded application.
